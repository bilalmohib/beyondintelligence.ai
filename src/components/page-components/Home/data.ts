        question: "How does getting started work? Is it complicated?",
        answer: `
        Not at all. Satori was built for parents who already have enough to manage.
There’s no app to download, no account to create, and no dashboard to learn. Once you sign up, Satori simply starts texting you protective alerts and forecasts for your child.
That same text message thread is how you manage everything — adding caregivers, updating your address, changing alert preferences, or pausing alerts. If you can send a text, you can use Satori.

        question: "How is Satori different from air quality apps?",
        answer: `
        Air quality apps show general conditions for a city.
Satori focuses on your child.
Instead of generic numbers, Satori looks at how changing air and weather conditions interact with your child’s specific triggers, routines, and sensitivities — and explains what those changes actually mean for their breathing, in real life.

        id: 3,
        question: "Is Satori medically legitimate?",
        answer: `
        Yes.
Satori is built on established pediatric asthma research and the same environmental triggers doctors warn families about — including pollution, ozone, weather shifts, and nighttime air changes linked to asthma flares and ER visits.
The guidance you receive reflects widely accepted exposure-reduction practices used by pediatric specialists.

        question: "How accurate are the alerts?",
        answer: `
        Satori combines live environmental data with pediatric risk patterns and timing windows to identify periods when breathing risk is rising.
Many parents tell us Satori catches danger windows they never would have noticed on their own — and explains why those moments matter for their child, not just that something changed.

        question: "Does Satori replace my child’s doctor?",
        answer: `
        No — and it’s not meant to.
Your doctor helps you manage asthma when symptoms happen.Satori helps you anticipate when symptoms are more likely to happen, so you can prepare.
Think of Satori as a protective layer that works between doctor visits, not instead of them.

        question: "What exactly do the alerts tell me?",
        answer: `
        Each alert is personalized for your child.
You’ll learn:
what’s changing in the environment,
why it matters for your child’s breathing,
simple steps you can take to reduce risk before symptoms begin.
Alerts are designed to be clear, calm, and actionable — not overwhelming.

        id: 7,
        question: "How early are the warnings?",
        answer: `
       Depending on the situation, Satori typically alerts you 1–6 hours before conditions become more concerning.
That time can help you adjust plans, reduce exposure, prepare nighttime routines, or simply stay ahead of potential trouble instead of reacting after symptoms start.
        `
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: "Will Satori wake me up at night?",
        answer: `
Only if it truly matters.
Most alerts arrive during normal hours, and many nighttime risks are flagged earlier in the evening so you have time to prepare.
If you prefer quieter nights, you can easily adjust alert settings by text. You’re always in control.

        id: 9,
        question: "Is my child’s data safe?",
        answer: `
        Yes. Protecting your child’s privacy is essential.
Satori does not track GPS, movement, browsing, or anything unrelated to air risk. We only use what’s necessary — like your address, your child’s age, and their triggers — to understand environmental conditions around them.
No ads. No tracking. No selling data.
