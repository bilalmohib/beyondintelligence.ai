        question: "How does getting started work? Is it complicated?",
        answer: `Not at all. Satori was built for parents who already have enough to manage.
        <br />
There’s no app to download, no account to create, and no dashboard to learn. Once you sign up, Satori simply starts texting you protective alerts and forecasts for your child.
<br />
That same text message thread is how you manage everything — adding caregivers, updating your address, changing alert preferences, or pausing alerts. If you can send a text, you can use Satori.

        question: "How is Satori different from air quality apps?",
        answer: `
        Air quality apps show general conditions for a city.
        <br />
Satori focuses on your <b>child</b>.
<br />
Instead of generic numbers, Satori looks at how changing air and weather conditions interact with your child’s specific triggers, routines, and sensitivities — and explains what those changes actually mean for their breathing, in real life.

        question: "Is Satori medically legitimate?",
        answer: `
        Yes.
        <br />
Satori is built on established pediatric asthma research and the same environmental triggers doctors warn families about — including pollution, ozone, weather shifts, and nighttime air changes linked to asthma flares and ER visits.
<br />
The guidance you receive reflects widely accepted exposure-reduction practices used by pediatric specialists.

        question: "How accurate are the alerts?",
        answer: `
        Satori combines live environmental data with pediatric risk patterns and timing windows to identify periods when breathing risk is rising.
        <br />
Many parents tell us Satori catches danger windows they never would have noticed on their own — and explains why those moments matter for their child, not just that something changed.

        id: 5,
        question: "Does Satori replace my child’s doctor?",
        answer: `
        No — and it’s not meant to.
        <br />
Your doctor helps you manage asthma when symptoms happen.Satori helps you anticipate when symptoms are more likely to happen, so you can prepare.
<br />
Think of Satori as a protective layer that works between doctor visits, not instead of them.

        id: 6,
        question: "What exactly do the alerts tell me?",
        answer: `
        Each alert is personalized for your child.
        <br />
You’ll learn:
<br />
<ul>
<li>what’s changing in the environment,</li>
<li>why it matters for your child’s breathing,</li>
<li>simple steps you can take to reduce risk before symptoms begin.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Alerts are designed to be clear, calm, and actionable — not overwhelming.

        id: 7,
        question: "How early are the warnings?",
        answer: `
        Depending on the situation, Satori typically alerts you <b>1–6 hours</b> before conditions become more concerning.
        <br />
That time can help you adjust plans, reduce exposure, prepare nighttime routines, or simply stay ahead of potential trouble instead of reacting after symptoms start.
        `
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: "Will Satori wake me up at night?",
        answer: `
        Only if it truly matters.
        <br />
Most alerts arrive during normal hours, and many nighttime risks are flagged earlier in the evening so you have time to prepare.
<br />
If you prefer quieter nights, you can easily adjust alert settings by text. You’re always in control.

    {
        id: 9,
        question: "Is my child’s data safe?",
        answer: `
        Yes. Protecting your child’s privacy is essential.
        <br />
Satori does <b>not</b> track GPS, movement, browsing, or anything unrelated to air risk. We only use what’s necessary — like your address, your child’s age, and their triggers — to understand environmental conditions around them.
<br />
No ads. No tracking. No selling data.
