This grounded, cause-and-effect approach allows risk to be identified earlier — before symptoms begin, not after."

Satori tracks these changes in real time, recognizing the precise moments they become risky for your child and alerting you with clear guidance on what to do right then."

        description: "At key moments, Satori may ask a simple yes-or-no question after an alert or forecast. These quick check-ins help it understand which risks truly affect your child, when symptoms really begin, and which guidance actually helps — so future alerts become fewer, earlier, and more precise, without you having to configure anything."

        description: "Satori identifies specific danger windows by aligning atmospheric physics with your child’s daily rhythm — understanding how risk changes between morning routines, school hours, afternoon activity, and nighttime rest. This allows alerts to arrive when they’re actually useful, not too early to ignore and not too late to help."

This allows guidance to be delivered when and where risk actually emerges — tailored to your child’s sensitivities, daily life, and surroundings, not adult thresholds or generic air scores."
